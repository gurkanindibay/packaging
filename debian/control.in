Description: sharding and distributed joins for PostgreSQL
 Citus is a distributed database implemented as a PostgreSQL extension. It
 provides functions to easily split a PostgreSQL table into shards to be
 placed on remote worker nodes. Citus can replicate shards, update their
 schemas, and keep track of shard health. An advanced distributed planner
 is included which handles queries and modifications against sharded tables.
